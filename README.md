# Salinity-Disease Literature Search

For Rocker et al., *Salt in the Wound: Consequences of changing salinities on marine disease*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiles and plots a Scopus search comparing the relative research effort into salinity, temperature,.and environment in marine diseases. Three search strings were developed to collect records of publications based on terms present in titles, keywords, and abstracts. To correct for irrelevant articles, a subset of 200 records from each search set were randomly selected and assessed, creating set-specific correction factors. After applying the correction factors to their respective search sets, the corrected number of publications were plotted against publication year.
